# DeAngstifier

Are you full of angst because you need to write a conference bio? I hear you. Writing bios is no fun.

So let a friendly robot do it for you! You give [DeAngstifier](https://thatandromeda.github.io/DeAngstifier/) some data; it'll do the writing. (Proofread, though; articles and prepositions are hard, and you're way better at them than the friendly robot.)

All the code is on the gh-pages branch.
